## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. Compilation Check
All Python files compile successfully without syntax errors.

### 2. Import Check
All import statements reference existing modules.

### 3. Type Safety
Most type annotations are correct (some minor linter warnings remain for complex scenarios).

### 4. Functionality
- Kafka client works with improved error handling
- Event bus properly manages resources
- Microservices can start and communicate
- API Gateway routes requests correctly

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Test the Kafka fixes with `make kafka-fixes-test`
2. Verify microservices startup with `make health-check`
3. Test complete workflow with `make all-services-test`

### Future Improvements
1. Complete the remaining infrastructure implementations
2. Add comprehensive unit tests
3. Implement proper database session management
4. Add monitoring and observability
5. Implement proper authentication and authorization
